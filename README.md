# organization-events
Listen for organization events

The purpose of this repository is to hold a web service that listens to organization events to know when a repository is created.
When the repository is created, the master branch is protected.

I created a WebHook in github for repository changes

I then created a web service using Ruby to change the protection but I did not see the change in github

Please note: I am not a web service developer. I develop java applications for desktop in Windows and Linux using Eclipse RCP and OSGi.

I have attached the ruby file in this repo
